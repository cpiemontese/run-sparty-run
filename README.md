# Run Sparty, Run!

This is an infinite-scroller/platformer made for the [Game Design and Development](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development) Coursera specialization.
It features MSU's mascot Sparty, a spartan.

## What is it about?

Sparty must run for his life for eternity jumping from one platform to the next and hoping not to fall in the lava below. 
The only way out is grabbing the rare rose that pops up from time to time.

## How can I play it?

The game is deployed on GitHub Pages [here](https://cpiemontese.github.io/run-sparty-run/). Otherwise you can clone the repo, run the Unity 2019 project and do whatever you like with it (within the limits of the license).
